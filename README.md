# Details

The Jarvis virtual assistant is built using several technologies and libraries in Python:

- **Speech Recognition**: Utilizes the `speech_recognition` library to convert spoken words into text, enabling interaction with the user via voice commands.
  
- **Text-to-Speech**: Employs the `pyttsx3` library to convert text responses into speech, allowing Jarvis to communicate with the user audibly.

- **Computer Vision**: Uses the `opencv-python` library to access and manipulate webcam feeds, enabling functionalities like opening the webcam.

- **Web Scraping**: Relies on `web-scraping` techniques to extract information from online sources, particularly for tasks such as searching on Wikipedia.

- **Web Browsing Automation**: Utilizes the `webbrowser` module to automate web browsing tasks, including opening websites like Google, YouTube, and social media platforms.

- **Network Requests**: Makes network requests to retrieve information such as the user's IP address, leveraging the `requests` library.

- **Date and Time Handling**: Utilizes the `datetime` module to handle date and time-related functionalities, such as determining the time of day for greetings.

- **File System Operations**: Performs `file system operations` such as opening files and directories using built-in Python functions and libraries.

- **Operating System Interaction**: Interacts with the underlying `operating system` for tasks such as opening applications (e.g., Notepad, Command Prompt) using built-in Python functions and libraries.

Now, the Jarvis virtual assistant is able to provide a range of functionalities and interact with users through natural language commands[English].
